Pawsitive Math - Final project in computer science  

## How to run  
- Please open the file through the software Xcode, it is free in the App Store.  
- Once opened, please select the iPhone preview to view it in its correct format.  

## Introduction  
This project aims to develop an educational game designed to create a fun and motivating learning platform aimed at children. The gamification of an educational app enhances the user’s engagement and enjoyability as they are rewarded by successfully completing the math quizzes. This application (Pawsitive Math) has implemented interactive gamified elements that allows the user to keep users engaged and entertained. The main feature of the application is its pet-caring abilities such as character customisation and status bars (energy, happiness and level) that gives the player sense of responsibility for their virtual pet. The status bars dynamically update based on the user’s performance in the maths quizzes.    

## Final implementation  
The final version of this application consists of the three main intended features: play page with randomly generated math quizzes, wardrobe page with accessories for character customisation and pet-caring feature with status bars for the pet. The player can gain rewards while successfully completing the math quizzes and use their rewarded points in the wardrobe page to purchase clothing customisation for their pet. There are three status bars: energy, happiness and level. The player can progress through the happiness and level bars by correctly answering the questions in the play page. The energy bar decreases as the player plays more games, and they will need to allow the pet to sleep to restore back the energy. The main technology used to implement this application is Xcode, Swift and Swift UI, using such technology allowed this project to be developed smoothly as they are very efficient for creating interactive UI designed for mobile devices as Xcode provides simulators for live previewing and testing the code. Blender was used to create 3D models of the bedroom platform and the pet; however, these models were not rendered properly on Xcode which resulted in being able to use only screenshots of these models for the final application.
